We believe artistry is more than acrobatics. It moves, inspires and opens a window into another world. For a moment, the everyday disappears and art becomes magic.\n\nBehind PepeShows are world champions and award-winning performers: a Cyr-wheel world champion, a seven-time juggling world champion, a BC One champion in breakdance – and many other international artists. Together we craft unique shows that unite energy, elegance and precision.\n\nOur repertoire ranges from short solo acts and dynamic 45-minute duo shows to full-evening variety programs (e.g. a 5-hour variety for the city of Gütersloh). Everything is possible – from dinner highlights to festival performances, with a clear focus on corporate events.\n\nFor organizers we provide technical packages – sound, light and rider are flexible: the full technical rider as well as logos, header images, press photos and trailers can be found in the media material.
