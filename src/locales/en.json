          "q": "How does the booking process work?",
          "a": "You can use our booking assistant – it guides you step by step through the request and sends it directly to suitable artists. Or simply book a phone appointment with us for general questions and advice."
        },
        "3": {
          "q": "How much lead time do I need for a booking?",
          "a": "Depending on the show, we recommend a few weeks’ lead time. Many acts can also be booked at short notice. Best to inquire as early as possible so we can guarantee the best options."

          "q": "What technical requirements are needed?",
          "a": "Requirements vary by show – for example stage height and rigging for aerials or safety distances for fire acts. Light and sound systems can be booked optionally. We advise individually and can handle the entire technical setup if needed."

          "q": "Can shows be customized?",

        "6": {
          "q": "How are prices calculated?",
          "a": "Together with our artists we’ve agreed on a fair pricing base. Fees depend on the type of show, effort, travel and technical needs. Just go through the booking assistant – it will immediately give you a price range."

          "q": "Do you offer flat rates or only custom quotes?",

        "8": {
          "q": "Are travel costs included in the price?",

        "9": {
          "q": "What does your booking assistant do?",
          "a": "In just a few minutes you’ll be asked for all the key details of your event – and it’s even fun! At the end you’ll receive a suitable offer with a price overview."
        },
        "10": {
          "q": "Will I have a dedicated contact person?",
          "a": "Yes, you’ll be looked after by a dedicated contact throughout the entire process. We coordinate artists, tech and run-of-show for you."

Together we create shows that blend emotion and precision.\n\nWhether a solo highlight after dinner, a 45-minute duo show or a full-evening variety performance like recently in Gütersloh: we stage events that last.

We believe artistry is more than acrobatics. It moves, inspires and opens a window into another world. For a moment, the everyday disappears and art becomes magic.\n\nBehind PepeShows are world champions and award-winning performers: a Cyr-wheel world champion, a seven-time juggling world champion, a BC One champion in breakdance – and many other international artists. Together we craft unique shows that unite energy, elegance and precision.\n\nOur repertoire ranges from short solo acts and dynamic 45-minute duo shows to full-evening variety programs (e.g. a 5-hour variety for the city of Gütersloh). Everything is possible – from dinner highlights to festival performances, with a clear focus on corporate events.\n\nFor organizers we provide technical packages – sound, light and rider are flexible: the full technical rider as well as logos, header images, press photos and trailers can be found in the media material. PepeShows makes artistry tangible – and lets audiences dream."
